## Collections

1. The `Collection` interface provides common methods for all collections, except for `maps` which are described by the `Map` interface.

2. A `list` is a sequential collection in which each element has an integer `index`.

3. A `set` is optimized for efficient containment testing. Java provides `HashSet` and `TreeSet` implementations.

4. For `maps`, you have the choice between `HashMap` and `TreeMap` implementations. A `LinkedHashMap` retains insertion order.

5. The `Collection` interface and `Collections` class provide many useful algorithms: `set` operations, `searching`, `sorting`, `shuffling`, and more.

6. `Views` provide access to data stored elsewhere using the standard collection interfaces.
